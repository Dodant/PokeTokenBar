# PokeTokenBar product facts

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

This repository branch is the public website for the native macOS app, not the app itself.

## Product Purpose

PokeTokenBar displays AI coding token usage in the macOS menu bar and uses accumulated tokens to hatch, evolve and collect Pokémon companions. A floating desktop pet is optional.

## Users

People using supported AI coding tools on a Mac. The installation and feature descriptions in the source README establish this audience. No user-count or conversion claims are established.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Requires macOS 14 or later; Apple Silicon and Intel are supported.
- Free, open-source, unofficial and non-commercial fan project. MIT covers the project's own source code.
- Install through `brew install --cask chattymin/tap/poke-token-bar` or the `PokeTokenBar.zip` GitHub release asset. Direct installation requires handling macOS Gatekeeper because the app is ad-hoc/self-signed. Homebrew's cask removes the quarantine attribute.
- Supported providers: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI, Pi Agent, omp, Aside, Kimi Code.
- Official usage limits are available for Claude, Codex and Antigravity. Do not imply official limits for every provider.
- Usage logs are not uploaded. The app makes network requests for provider usage/limits, Pokémon data and sprites, service status and updates. Do not claim it is completely offline.
- Companions hatch, evolve and graduate into a collection. Growth difficulty is adjustable. Rare Candy and the token shop affect progress; a fixed completion time is not a promise.
- The website supports English, Korean and Japanese. The app supports eight UI languages, including Russian; website language support is separate.
- Supported Gen 1–5 forms are retained per individual through evolution, saving and export. Form-specific types, stats, abilities and moves are not modeled: metadata uses the default form.
- Rare Candy supports quantity selection and an evolution/graduation preview with carryover; the Shop shows quantity and total price.
- Monthly daily bars use a fixed full-month axis, stacking by provider with a legend when at least two providers have usage in the month. Hover shows total/per-provider usage, with cost when enabled; idle days retain weekly/monthly history.
- Recaps cover past weeks/months/years with exact-count hovers and a shortcut to the current period.
- Automatic backup history starts collapsed; manual backup creation remains visible.

## Stack

Existing static HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the orphan `gh-pages` branch, served by GitHub Pages at https://chattymin.github.io/PokeTokenBar/. No website build step.

## Evidence on Hand

- Main branch README files, native source and release documentation are the product authorities.
- Nineteen 2.5.6 Home/gallery PNGs are byte-identical native production-view renders with isolated sample data. They are not live user usage. Capture source/tree, exact view scope and fallbacks are in `assets/README-release-2.5.6.md`.
- Forms, Bag, Shop, difficulty, daily trend and recap samples have EN/KO/JA images selected with the page language. The common Home image stays English and says so in all three languages.
- The retained quota, pace, collection and desktop-pet demonstrations are English examples; their captions remain separate from native sample labels.
- Download counts are requests, including upgrades and repeats. They are not unique users and are omitted from public social proof.
- No testimonials, customer logos, performance benchmarks or conversion figures have been supplied.
